# Diabetes Predictor
Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning.

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI and various other features.  We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web app using streamlit. 

Check out the live Demo of the App: [WebApp](https://diabetes-predictionmodel-tarun.herokuapp.com/)

Diabetes is an increasingly growing health issue due to our inactive lifestyle. If it is detected in time then through proper medical treatment, adverse effects can be prevented. To help in early detection, technology can be used very reliably and efficiently. Using machine learning we have built a predictive model that can predict whether the patient is diabetes positive or not.
